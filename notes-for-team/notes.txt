FROM EMILY: I created the shrubs files in the models, controllers, and routes folders,
but I haven't tested them yet.

I also included an authorization.js file in this notes-for-team folder that shows
how I did the authorization on the last project.


FROM CHERYL 6/21: This looks great Emily, and I like this idea for notes.  I cleaned up the app.js file
by deleting the way I had connected to MondgoDb and also got rid of my db/connection file since Marc set
it up to use Mongoose.  

From Daniel 6/21: I have added the controller, models, routes for the grasses.  When I try to test them with 
thunder client I get 200 codes but I do not see any data and when I type localhost:6000 in a web browser I get
this site can't be reached message.

From Marc 6/22: I deployed our project to https://landscapingapi.onrender.com and updated the swagger.js file. Also updated the swagger.json with this new link. Worked on grass routes. Made a couple of edits to get working.

6/22: Marc found a problem with tree model. Marc had classified some of the fields as String when they were actually type: Array. The queries were dropping all of the fields that were arrays giving a shortened version of the data. Marc replaced type: String with type: Array and the query works properly now. Marc also changed the flower and shrub models for the same reason. Also had to remove enum in model on arrays as only can be used on type String.
