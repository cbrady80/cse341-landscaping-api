FROM EMILY: I created the shrubs files in the models, controllers, and routes folders,
but I haven't tested them yet.

I also included an authorization.js file in this notes-for-team folder that shows
how I did the authorization on the last project.


FROM CHERYL 6/21: This looks great Emily, and I like this idea for notes.  I cleaned up the app.js file
by deleting the way I had connected to MondgoDb and also got rid of my db/connection file since Marc set
it up to use Mongoose.
