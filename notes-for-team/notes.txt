FROM EMILY: I created the shrubs files in the models, controllers, and routes folders,
but I haven't tested them yet.

I also included an authorization.js file in this notes-for-team folder that shows
how I did the authorization on the last project.


FROM CHERYL 6/21: This looks great Emily, and I like this idea for notes.  I cleaned up the app.js file
by deleting the way I had connected to MondgoDb and also got rid of my db/connection file since Marc set
it up to use Mongoose.  

From Daniel 6/21: I have added the controller, models, routes for the grasses.  When I try to test them with 
thunder client I get 200 codes but I do not see any data and when I type localhost:6000 in a web browser I get
this site can't be reached message.

From Marc 6/22: I deployed our project to https://landscapingapi.onrender.com and updated the swagger.js file. Also updated the swagger.json with this new link. Worked on grass routes. Made a couple of edits to get working.
